# Platformer Game

This is a simple platformer game using pygame. It's my final project for
the advanced section of [Python Programming MOOC 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/).

## How to run?

1. Download and install **uv** from the [astral website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Open the project directory on a terminal and type the following, then press enter:

```shell
uv run main.py
```

**uv** will take care of installing the correct python version, the correct pygame package and running the game, all
with just one command.
